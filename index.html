                        <p>End-to-End Continuous Sign Language Recognition is a cutting-edge approach to automatically recognizing sign language from continuous video input. 
                         By combining advanced deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTM), and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), the model can process continuous sequences of gestures and accurately map them to corresponding text or speech without the need for manual segmentation.
